    <p>
        My prose work is where I do most of my character studies, yet I don't focus on fantasy or horror very much here. Most of these stories, like my scripts, take place in same universe (save for Eye am Dallon and Gray), in the same version of New York City. There are dark themes here as well, in almost all stories.

    </h5>
    <p>Bringing back a crowd favorite in Adrien Callahan, this flash-fiction piece is about the warden of the prison, yes the same prison in all the others, meeting this out-loud character, not thinking he’s cut out for the tough times ahead. While small, I talk about themes of stereotypes and entitlement</p>

    </h5>
    <p>This full short story follows Andy, a small but tough boy in juvy battling his inner demons and using a method called ‘holding his breath’ to hide his emotions and true intentions. He and his two cellmates, Josh and Donovan, navigate this life together, but after seeing Josh’s true feelings for Donovan, his tactic begins to fall though. Watch as he fights through themes of homophobia, violence, self-loathing, fear, and redemption.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>A piece of flash fiction for creative writing. The assignment was to make a plot-driven piece out of random events thrown at us. Some of these included a blind date, a text from a meme website, and ending in tears. While difficult, I managed to turn this into a dramatic origin story for Jack, an engineer for the Seven Deadly Sins Gang, and how he met his eventual lover. While not my best piece, I wanted to show my creative writing work for my class while talking about fast choices.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>Returning with Andy, Josh, and Donovan and yet again talking about fear, this detailed excerpt from a short story called “Bound” follows the boys as they’re transferred from the world they knew to a much harsher land. Themes of fear are the most prominent in this bit.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>An excerpt from a story titled “Tony,” this dramatic bit follows the title character defying expectations. He’s a big, scary man and extremely talented fighter, who surprisingly has an affinity for the guitar and peace. The story’s all about defying expectations and stereotypes, and the importance of having restraints on yourself.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>An excerpt bringing back Tamara, the story being titled “Black and Blue,” we’re introduced to the inner thoughts of an extremely strong gang leader, dealing with the pressure of her gang, The Seven Deadly Sins, who’s almost like her family. The story talks about pride, disappointment, brutality, and the importance of how a little good can go a long way in a hard situation.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>A full short story that doubled as my Creative Writing midterm this year. This one, while still a crime drama, is most likely the hardest hitting to home, most dramatic, and best written prose piece I’ve done. It follows Damien, a tattoo-artist and gang member as he navigates the tough road to redemption for his husband and son. After a run-in with a rival gang member that gets him on the news, tensions rise and he must decide what’s right, losing his only source of income to keep his son safe, or do something so risky in order to protect those in need. It talks about the importance of family and love, and how morals are strikingly different for different people, and sometimes there is no right answer.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>One of the few times I’ve written horror, this was for a creative writing project where we had to make a sympathetic monster. The story follows a blind man, who’s furious with the idea of being blind. After he wakes up one night, he finds himself transformed into a being, but with an insatiable taste for eyes. Every night he turns into this monster, not remembering what happens when he wakes up. The dark story has themes of selfishness and self-preservation.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>This fantasy/reality story is extremely dark despite its fantasy blanket. The plot follows a man, named Gray, who’s incapable of feeling or even sensing anything. He meets a woman named Iris, who makes color come back to his life. This tough story talks about depression and love and how they intertwine.</p>

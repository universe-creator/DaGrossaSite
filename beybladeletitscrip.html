    Scripts

<div id="Descrip3">
    <p>
       My scripts have the widest range of topics and subject matter. The shows I've written range from ten minute shows to one act plays, to unfinihed two acts, to concepts for full musicals. Here you'll see all of the above, showing you the process I take while writing.

<h4>
    Realistic Drama
</h4>
<div id="Descrip3">
    <p>
        Here is where the crime drama and depression sink in. I'd like to think that most of these take place in the same universe, if that makes sense. A warning though, most of these stories deal with sensitive situations, including murder, death, suicide, and others along the same lines. So a warning for those of you who decide to read on.

<h4>
    Fantasy Comedy
</h4>
<div id="Descrip3">
    <p>
        Here is where the nonsensical and odd stories live. Between nihilistic gods, wars over love itself, and interplanetary gang fights, I've found that ridiculous stories can convery concepts just as easily as those which are realistic.

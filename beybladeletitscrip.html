    Scripts
</h2>
<div id="Descrip3">
    <p>
       My scripts have the widest range of topics and subject matter. The shows I've written range from ten minute shows to one act plays, to unfinihed two acts, to concepts for full musicals. Here you'll see all of the above, showing you the process I take while writing.

<h4>
    Realistic Drama
</h4>
<div id="Descrip3">
    <p>
        Here is where the crime drama and depression sink in. I'd like to think that most of these take place in the same universe, if that makes sense. A warning though, most of these stories deal with sensitive situations, including murder, death, suicide, and others along the same lines. So a warning for those of you who decide to read on.

    </h5>
    <p>This is a ten-minute play about a very tough subject, and one that one me a Scholastics Silver Key. The story follows two cellmates, Biel and Adrien, as the former struggles to hide a dark power struggle between him and a guard. His best friend attempts to find out and solve the issue between them both. It’s a dark yet hopeful piece about trust and friendship in the face of darkness.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>Another ten-minute play, this one about four gang leaders, Jonas, Ty, Elle, and Tamara, struggling to find out who started a fight. While dramatic, it has comedic lines and a much lighter tone. It touches on themes of violence and manipulation, but in a more subtle way</p>

    </h5>
    <p>A monologue following a teenage girl named Zephyr as she deals with individuality and independence, both at home and in her city life. It’s a loud and proud monologue about being yourself and having courage in that.</p>

        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kazFzE3jZsZuDLFbqndMn4cIE3XJjeaO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">"Fish Tank"</a>
    </h5>
    <p>A monologue about a teen boy named Andy attempting to convince himself that he’s tough and can handle something as hard as juvy. It talks about what real courage is and how looks can be decieving.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>An excerpt from a show called “High Security.” Back to Adrien and Biel, the short story follows the two as they first meet, starting happy and friendly, but slowly morphs into one about anger. This story talks about friendship, fear, and deception.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>A small scene for a creative writing project in which the object was to tell a compelling story with no dialogue. Written through stage directions, it follows a woman and man. The woman is rich and stops at a bus station while the man is poor and begging for money for food. While short, it effectively stops on themes of poverty and selfishness.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>Another small scene for creative writing. The object of this was to have an issue completely comprised of dialogue, but not to reveal what the issue was openly. The story follows two recurring gang leaders, Tamara and Jonas, having comedic banter at a bar while celebrating a ‘contract’ of sorts. Even through comedy, it talks about friendships and how life-changing events can change them.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>Bringing back Zephyr and teen issues, this is an excerpt from a play called “Utopia, as Defined by Four Dystopian Survivors.” The scenes included are about four teens, Zephyr, Mia, Keon, and Peyton, as they run away for a road trip of sorts. It talks about the need to escape reality and high tensions.</p>

<h4>
    Fantasy Comedy
</h4>
<div id="Descrip3">
    <p>
        Here is where the nonsensical and odd stories live. Between nihilistic gods, wars over love itself, and interplanetary gang fights, I've found that ridiculous stories can convery concepts just as easily as those which are realistic.

        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JtewVPnhcFH9_Pr6Lga-BZIXjVvLlgEQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Stupendous Amazing Death Hotel</a>
    </h5>
    <p>A full one act horror comedy following two gods, the benevolent Life and malevolent Death, the latter wishing to kill five selfish humans before their time. He and his wife have an agreement and decide to kill them, but this results in an innocent boy dying. There’s many crazy characters, including a hotheaded racer, a narcissistic prince, a nerdy vlogger, a psychotic doctor, and a promiscuous designer. The comedy does mask darker subjects, like suicide, death, and alcoholism, but also has lighter things like friendship, redemption, and, of course, Mario Kart.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>An old scene, included for both balance and to show improvement, on a show that’s been done and redone and will eventually (hopefully) become a musical. The show, titled “Astronomy VS. Astrology” follows humanoid representations of the zodiac and planets, as they fight in an intergalactic war for the power to create and destroy the universe. This scene follows the Zodiac Team as we’re introduced to all of them. Although the party is broken up by gods and the planets, it still jokes about authority, teamwork, and the media as a whole.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>A full one act romantic comedy about two kingdoms. One, named Osmio, is a tech-savvy world in which love is illegal, seen to affect decision making. The other, called Cimini, is a renaissance-esque world where love is everything, distributed through a drug called PaSSioN. A prince in Cimini named Luca and a criminal in Osmio named Blake meet by chance at the wall separating the kingdoms, only to fall in love. This spells doom for both, as Blake becomes Public Enemy Number One for the robotic chief of police and her bumbling cohort, and as Luca is chastised by his kingly father for interacting with those who can’t love. Themes of homosexuality and the importance of love are huge factors in this science-fiction oddity.</p>
